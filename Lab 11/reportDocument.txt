Example 1:
	Vulnerability: Code Execution
	Explanation: 
		Since the input for the command comes directly from the user without any validation
		the user can send any command they want to execute. This is because the string isn't
		checked for any special characters. They could even escape the rm command and execute
		an entirely different one if they desired to.

	Possible Fix:
		Make a whitelist of allowed characters so that this isn't possible.
		Use the escapeshellcmd function so that the entire input is escaped.

Example 2:
	Vulnerability: XSS
	Explanation:
		Since the server echos input that comes directly from the user without validation,
		they can send anything they want to. This enables them to get the server to echo
		malicious code to it's clients and get them to run it locally.
	Possible Fix:
		Use htmlentities function to transform input into html.

Example 3:
	Vulnerability: File Inclusion
	Explanation:
		Since the file to include comes from the user and is not validated it could be
		abused to even include remote files. These files are then executed or interpreted
		which could compromise the system.
	Possible Fix:
		Build a whitelist of files that are safe to include.

Example 4:
	Vulnerability: SQL Injection
	Explanation:
		Since the input from the user is not validated, it could be manipulated to escape
		the first WHERE clause and match an always true statement like 1=1. This would
		then return every tuple in the products table.
	Possible Fix:
		Use mysql_real_escape_string to escape all special characters, removing the possibility
		of this injection.
